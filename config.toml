  bio = """Hi I'm Joe, a  backend software engineer.

My tech journey has been an interesting ride, and along the way, I've become proficient in multiple technologies and skills. 
From languages like C++, Go, Python, C#, and JavaScript to orchestrating projects with tools like CMake and Git, 

My knowledge of backend solutions led me to embrace robust technologies like PostgreSQL and SQL, enabling me to architect scalable and efficient databases. 
Along with cloud computing, leveraging AWS, Docker and Kubernetes to deploy and manage applications securely.

Beyond my professional endeavors, I'm passionate about contributing to open source projects, fueling my commitment to innovation and collaboration within the tech community.

When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you'll often find me playing my guitar and spending quality time with my partner and daughter.
